# PowerShell ![icons8-powershell-48](C:\Users\Martina Atkinson\OneDrive - Atlantic TU\PGDiplomaCloud\IAC\Assignment2\PowerShell\icons8-powershell-48.png)

This repository contains exercise files from the PowerShell section of the Infrastructure as Code Module.  The lecturer provided technical walkthroughs and script files, completed by the students and uploaded to their GitHub accounts.  These walkthroughs gave students a great insight into PowerShell, as they were shown how to install the software, taught the language's syntax, performed scripted installations, and automated configuration tasks using Desired State Configuration. While no previous knowledge of PowerShell was required, a basic understanding of programming principles was necessary to complete some of the tasks.

### Requirements 

- VMware Workstation or Hyper-V
- Windows 2019 Desktop Experience Server
- Windows 2019 Core Server 
- PowerShell 7.3  software
- Visual Studio Code with PowerShell extension. 
- GitHub Account

### Content

**Walkthrough 1 (WK1 )**

In the first walkthrough, students were required to install and configure PowerShell 7.3, set a script execution policy, install NuGet, and update PowerShellGet module to work with the  PowerShell Gallery.  They were also asked to install Visual Studio Code with a PowerShell extension. 

**Walkthrough 2 (WK2)**

In the second walkthrough, students were taught the basic syntax of the PowerShell language,  with the lecturer providing theory and code examples for variables, data types, operators, control and data structures such as loops and arrays. 

**Walkthrough 3 (WK3)**

In the third walkthrough, students used the two servers and scripts provided by the lecturer to build a domain with Active Directory (AD), Domain Names System (DNS) and Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP). As a further challenge, the Core server was configured remotely from the Desktop Server. 

**Walkthrough 4 (WK4)**

In walkthrough 4, students were shown how Desired State Configuration (DSC), could be used to automate the configuration of Windows or Linux, which is particularly useful for system administrators. The lecturer provided a DSC configuration file to generate a Managed Object Format (MOF) file, which was used to configure the Desktop server.

**GitHub**

Students also learnt how to use Git and GitHub as part of the Infrastructure as Code module. For practice, they were required to create this repository to store their PowerShell exercise files, creating a branching structure with a bug_fix  branch to test their knowledge and skills.  The WT3 files were used for this purpose, as some of the lecturer's scripts had to be amended to suit the local setup.

### Project Status

All the tasks in the walkthroughs were completed successfully. The lecturer unlocked the potential of PowerShell in this course.  All that remains is for the student to build on these solid foundations, as it has been shown that knowledge of PowerShell is a great asset to any, particularly system administrators, wishing to automate through infrastructure as a code.
